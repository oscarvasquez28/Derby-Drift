# Derby Drift

## Computer Graphics for Web Applications Class

### Introduction
Derby Drift is an online multiplayer web app created using Three.js for rendering and cannon-es as the physics engine. The game features two exciting gamemodes that promise fun and competitive play.

### Gamemodes
1. **Racing Mode**
   - Race against other players connected to the server in real-time on a track for three laps.
   - Beware of the Dobeto walking around; try your best to avoid hitting him!

2. **Colosseum Mode**
   - In this .io-like gamemode, face off in an arena against all other players connected to the server. The last one standing wins.

### Power-ups
Across all three maps, you'll find three distinct power-ups:
- **Missile**: Shoot at your foes to bring them destruction.
- **Boost**: Almost double your max speed, but be cautious of crashing into walls!
- **Shield**: Protect yourself against the next missile that collides with your vehicle.

### Difficulty
Select your preferred difficulty before entering any gamemode:
- **Easy Mode**: For the faint of heart.
- **Hard Mode**: Dare to try the hard mode where it only takes one hit to bring you down.
